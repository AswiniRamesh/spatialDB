# Big Rational Arithmetic and Robust Geometric Primitives
Spatial data is often large and default implementations of datatypes like Integer, Float and Double in C++ aren’t equipped to deal with data in this format, since it frequently exceeds their bounds of computation. A new data type is thus required to support computations on spatial data which sometimes needs to be accurate to a precision level which might not be supported by already available datatypes.
‘BigRational’ will allow us to store and perform operations on the type of spatial data that gives trouble to the default implementations. Such an implementation requires a robust arithmetic operations to be defined, like the mathematical operators “+, - , /, * and %”. In addition to these, I/O operations (input and output) for a BigRational number are also required.
Any data type in a language can be converted to a different datatype by type casting. One BigRational number should have the ability to be converted into a different type. Thus, the system shall support conversions from BigFloat to BigInt, BigDouble to BigInt and so on.
